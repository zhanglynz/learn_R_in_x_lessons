R is a general purpose computer language R is the best for dealing with data R has such a good IDE (Integrated Development Environment), RStudio R has so many valuable/powerful packages R has a very good ecosystem R is free What to learn? base R R packages workflows How to learn? try to learn from the best resources grasp the basics aim to problem solving with R write many R scrips learn incessantly "],["L1.html", "1 Lesson 1 Getting Ready 1.1 Get R and Rstudio 1.2 Use RStuio to install R packages 1.3 Explore Rstudio", " 1 Lesson 1 Getting Ready 1.1 Get R and Rstudio We need to Download R from CRAN Install Rjust use the default settings Download RStudio from RStudio/posit Install RStudio 1.2 Use RStuio to install R packages Open RStudio. Click on File&gt;New File&gt;R Script, next copy the following R code and paste it to the screen called Untitled1 install.packages(c(&quot;dplyr&quot;, &quot;tidyr&quot;)) install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) install.packages(&quot;data.table&quot;) Run each line of code by i) moving the cursor in that line; ii) pressing down Ctrl key then clicking on Enter key 1.3 Explore Rstudio Tasks : Figure out how to create a new project, called my_proj_1 Figure out how to create an R script, called try_1.R, which is under the just created project my_proj_1 and contains the following R code 1+1 print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) rnorm(5) Figure out how to run R code in try_1.R: a) line by line; b) all three lines together.

Firstly, think about how to solve the problem by yourself; and then study the example R code. Example 1: Write an R program to plot \\(f(x)=\\sin(x)\\) (black color) and \\(g(x)=\\cos(x)\\) (red color) together; \\(x\\) takes values from \\(-2\\pi\\) to \\(2\\pi\\). x &lt;- seq(-2*pi, 2*pi, by = 0.01) y_1 &lt;- sin(x) y_2 &lt;- cos(x) plot(x, y_1, type = &#39;l&#39;, col = &#39;black&#39;, xlab = &#39;x&#39;, ylab = &#39;y&#39;, main = &quot;Plot of sin(x) (black) and cos(x) (red)&quot;) points(x, y_2, type = &#39;l&#39;, col = &#39;red&#39;) abline(h = 0, lty = 2) abline(v = 0, lty = 2) Example 2: Check all integers from 1 to 100: if an integer is multiple of 5, then output F; if the integer is multiple of 7, then output S; if its multiple of both 5 and 7, then output FS; otherwise just output the integer. nbr &lt;- 1:100 output &lt;- rep(&quot;&quot;, times = 100) for(i in nbr) { s &lt;- &quot;&quot; if(i %% 5 == 0) s &lt;- &quot;F&quot; if(i %% 7 == 0) s &lt;- paste0(s, &quot;S&quot;) if(s != &quot;&quot;) {output[i] &lt;- s } else {output[i] &lt;- i} } print(output) ## [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;6&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;8&quot; &quot;9&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;11&quot; &quot;12&quot; &quot;13&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;F&quot; ## [16] &quot;16&quot; &quot;17&quot; &quot;18&quot; &quot;19&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;22&quot; &quot;23&quot; &quot;24&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;26&quot; &quot;27&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;29&quot; &quot;F&quot; ## [31] &quot;31&quot; &quot;32&quot; &quot;33&quot; &quot;34&quot; &quot;FS&quot; &quot;36&quot; &quot;37&quot; &quot;38&quot; &quot;39&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;41&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;43&quot; &quot;44&quot; &quot;F&quot; ## [46] &quot;46&quot; &quot;47&quot; &quot;48&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;51&quot; &quot;52&quot; &quot;53&quot; &quot;54&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;57&quot; &quot;58&quot; &quot;59&quot; &quot;F&quot; ## [61] &quot;61&quot; &quot;62&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;64&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;66&quot; &quot;67&quot; &quot;68&quot; &quot;69&quot; &quot;FS&quot; &quot;71&quot; &quot;72&quot; &quot;73&quot; &quot;74&quot; &quot;F&quot; ## [76] &quot;76&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;78&quot; &quot;79&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;81&quot; &quot;82&quot; &quot;83&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;86&quot; &quot;87&quot; &quot;88&quot; &quot;89&quot; &quot;F&quot; ## [91] &quot;S&quot; &quot;92&quot; &quot;93&quot; &quot;94&quot; &quot;F&quot; &quot;96&quot; &quot;97&quot; &quot;S&quot; &quot;99&quot; &quot;F&quot; Example 3: Write an R function to calculate how old you are in days. library(lubridate) # to use function days() how_old_in_days &lt;- function(`birth_day_yyyy-mm-dd`) {today &lt;- Sys.Date() life_in_days &lt;- days(today - as.Date(`birth_day_yyyy-mm-dd`)) print(life_in_days) } how_old_in_days(&quot;2005-12-04&quot;) # today is &quot;2022-12-25&quot; ## [1] &quot;6230d 0H 0M 0S&quot; "],["L3.html", "3 Lesson 3 R Essentials", " 3 Lesson 3 R Essentials "],["L4.html", "4 Lesson 4 Data Structure", " 4 Lesson 4 Data Structure "],["L5.html", "5 Lesson 5 Write Your Own Functions", " 5 Lesson 5 Write Your Own Functions "],["L6.html", "6 Lesson 6 Making Plots", " 6 Lesson 6 Making Plots "],["L7.html", "7 Lesson 7 Data Manipulation", " 7 Lesson 7 Data Manipulation "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
